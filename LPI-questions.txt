I am quite skilled in network design and support, and looking to translate that into cloud roles.
I have strong analytic skills, and can very easily research on a new topic, whilst coming up with desired results.
I work well with as part of a team, and have an ever improving customer service skills.
As i have worked both as an employer and employee, it gives me a much more balanced approach as to requirements from a company's view point.
I am extremely focused on my golas, with very little external distractions.

C. The shim.efi boot loader loads another boot loader, which is grubx64.efi by default. 
The other options are not valid filenames for the purpose described.
68. D. The /etc/rc.d hierarchy contains symbolic links to files found within /etc/init.d. 
These symlinks are then used for executing the scripts at the appropriate runlevel. For 
example, on boot the system will execute the scripts found in the runlevel directory for each 
runlevel executed at boot time.
69. A. The default.target is the default target unit that is activated by systemd on boot. 
The default target then starts other services based on the dependencies.
70. B. LUNs that contain the characters fc are found through Fibre Channel. Therein lies the 
difference between options B and C, where option C contains the letters scsi, which would 
usually represent a local disk. The other options are not valid.
71. B. NVMe-capable drives are named /dev/nvme*. No special drivers are needed other than 
those found in the native kernel on a modern system. The other options do not exist as 
paths by default.
72. D. The /proc/mdstat file contains information on RAID arrays, including RAID 
personalities found on the system, the devices that comprise the array, and other pertinent 
information. The other files shown are not valid.
73. B. The /sys/class/fc_host directory contains other directories based on the Fibre 
Channel connections available. Within those host directories will be found the WWN in a 
file called port_name. The other directory hierarchies are not valid.
74. C. The /dev/mapper directory contains information about multipath devices such as 
logical volumes. The other directories are not valid.
75. C. The lspci command will be used for this purpose. NVMe devices are listed with the 
name nVME or NVMe; therefore, adding -i to grep will make the search case insensitive. 
You’d use this in order to ensure that the devices are detected. The other commands are 
not valid, with the exception of the lspci command, but you cannot grep for scsi in this 
scenario.
76. D. Tape devices are found within /dev/st*, making st0 the first device.
77. C. The /etc/issue file is used to provide a message to users, such as a login banner, prior 
to local login. The other files shown are not valid for the purpose described.
78. C. The contents of the file motd, an abbreviation for Message of the Day, are displayed 
when a user logs in successfully. Among the other options, the contents of /etc/issue are 
displayed prior to local login. The other filenames are not valid for this purpose.
79. B. The /etc/issue.net file is used to provide a message for remote logins such as telnet. 
The other files listed are not valid for the purpose described.
80. D. The poweroff target of systemd, accessed using the systemctl command, is used for 
halting the system and then attempting to remove power on compatible systems. The halt
target stops the system but does not attempt to remove power, whereas reboot simply 
restarts the system. There is no stop target.
226 Appendix ■ Answers to Review Questions
81. A. The -r option is needed to specify reboot, and the format for counting time from now is 
prefaced with a plus sign (+), making option A correct. Of the other commands, specifying 
+15 without the -r option simply shuts down the computer in 15 minutes, and specifying 
the time as 00:15, as in option D, will shut down the computer at 12:15 a.m.
82. A. The service command is used to work with services, such as starting and stopping 
them. On newer systems, the systemctl command has replaced the service command.
83. A. The journalctl command with the -b option displays boot messages.
84. A. The -h option halts the system, including shutting down acpid-related hardware.
85. C. The number 9 corresponds to SIGKILL and can be passed to the kill command to 
issue that signal. The number 1 is SIGHUP. Others can be found within the manual for the 
kill command.
86. C. The /etc/init.d directory contains the startup and shutdown scripts for services on a 
Debian system that is not running systemd.
87. A. Among the options, examining the boot messages would be a first logical step and 
would prevent having to reboot the system. Rebooting may be a next step in order to 
examine the status of the peripheral within the BIOS.
88. C. The -n option prevents the banner from displaying when using wall. The other options 
shown are not used with the wall command.
